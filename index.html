          Each coffee bean appearing every 6 seconds symbolizes the average
          amount of manual labor involved in its production — from harvesting
          and drying to sorting and packaging. While many stages happen in bulk,
          this estimate reflects the time and effort that goes into every single
          bean before it reaches your cup.

          <h2>How Long Did You Really Watch?</h2>
          <p>
            The truth is that we often lack the patience to appreciate the
            significant labour that goes into the coffee we enjoy every day.
            While an espresso takes only 25 to 30 seconds to brew, only three
            out of the required 64 coffee beans have been harvested during that
            brief period. Behind every sip lies hours of physically demanding
            work. This involves planting, hand-picking, drying, sorting, and
            roasting. Most of this work is executed by underpaid workers in the
            Global South, while the largest coffee consumers remain in the
            Global North. The gap between the swift consumption of coffee and
            the tedious, labour-intensive production process represents the
            disregarded inequality and invisibility of labour in the global
            coffee supply chain.

  <h2>Meeting the Benchmark</h2>
  <div class="content">

      <p>
        Fair trade associations have long worked to define a living income benchmark defined as “the net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members.” This benchmark is central to address one of key challenges that coffee farmers face: poverty. Its aim is to ensure that families earn enough to meet their basic needs and have a decent standard of living.
        <br><br>
        However, as this visualization shows, most households in the world’s top five coffee-producing countries are still showing a significant income gap.
        <br><br>
        The same beans that fuel productivity and wealth around the world are harvested by families trapped in poverty, exposing a serious imbalance at the core of the coffee industry. Acknowledging this disparity is the first step towards building a fairer system that values the people behind the product.

          <h2>From Seed to Sip: A Story of Inequality</h2>
          <p>
            Today's coffee industry has a complex and deeply rooted history
            which links back to colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade.
            Also known as the triangular trade, the transatlantic slave trade
            forcibly took enslaved Africans to work on plantations in the
            Americas. This system of trade operated in three stages:

            European merchants transported manufactured items, including
            textiles, alcohol, and weapons, to Africa in exchange for enslaved
            individuals.

            This stage, also referred to as the Middle Passage, transported

            This final stage transported plantation products such as coffee,

        <div class="text2">
          <p>
            The slave trade set the foundation of today's global trade habits,
            which we can see through today's coffee distribution. These events
            shifted global power, distinguishing the Global North as more
            dominant. When comparing the two maps, a distinct pattern between
            the transatlantic slave trade and global coffee distribution becomes
            apparent. The same regions that once enslaved individuals to work on
            plantations now obtain major coffee-consuming markets. Those
            countries import large quantities of coffee produced in the same
            areas where enslaved people were once forced to work on plantations.
            People of colour continue to be exploited within the supply chain,
            supplying demanding labour while often receiving very little
            compensation. The sector continues to reflect deep economic
            disparities, characterised by a clear racial and ethnic divide
            between those who profit and those who perform extensive labour.

      We chose to use the Pan-African flag colours—red, black, and green—to visually represent the historical and racialised labour behind the coffee trade. Red symbolises the blood shed through centuries of enslavement and exploitation, black stands for the African people whose forced labour built global industries, and green represents the rich land that was cultivated at great human cost. By embedding these colours into the map’s trade routes, we aimed to memorialise the suffering, resilience, and systemic injustice experienced by enslaved and exploited workers—making their invisible labour visible to today’s coffee consumers.
